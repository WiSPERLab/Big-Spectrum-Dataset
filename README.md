# Big-Spectrum-Dataset
Datasets of cognitive adhoc network with pairs of senders-receivers nodes. The database can be used for generating empirical models for spectrum awareness in networks and also for validating analytical models.

Different network scenarios (termed design points) were simulated and experimented. Each scenario was formed by varying the network parameters. 

The simulation model is available for download at https://github.com/WiSPERLab/SASim.

The complete dataset obtained from OMNeT++ simulation is available for download at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gK5Ue9vqy75ymAUzLq9x0diVxAQXoqx5?usp=sharing.
